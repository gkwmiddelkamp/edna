# If you want to allow downloading of tar archives of directory contents,

[acl]
# if passwords below are not in plain text, you can specify the hash :

# If you wish to restrict to certain hostnames or IP address, specify them here

# If you wish to use password protection, enter user password pairs here
#auth = aUser1:aPass1, aUser2:aPass2

# This defines which URLs are protected by a password.  Some MP3 players cannot
# handle authentication, for these use either 0 or 1.
# 0  Only check '/'
# 1  Check for all directory indexes (default)
# 2  Check for all requests
#auth_level=2

[sources]
#
# List each source directory (top of the tree). The lines should be of the
# form:
#   dirNNN = DIRECTORY = DISPLAY_NAME
#
# WARNING: the DISPLAY-NAME part may *not* have a slash ("/") in it!
# WARNING: each DIRECTORY must exist when edna is started
#
# The NNN part will determine the sort order in the top-level listing.
#

# Windows example:
#dir1 = f:\mp3\transfer = MP3s
#dir2 = f:\bobsmp3  = Bob
#dir3 = g:\MP3's = Bob CD

# Unix example:
dir1 = /mp3 = MP3

[filename_cache]
#
# The server can keep a cached list of filenames which speeds
# up searches. 
#
# Refreshes are scheduled once when the server starts and then on a
# schedule which starts 'refresh_offset' seconds after midnight and
# repeatedly 'refresh_interval' seconds thereafter.
#
# If either the offset or the interval is less than 0, then nothing
# is cached; this means that every search will hit the filesystem
# at the time it is requested.
#
# Refresh the cache every 5 minutes 
#  refresh_offset = 0 
#  refresh_interval = 300 
# Don't cache filenames
#  refresh_offset = -1 
#  refresh_interval = -1 
# Refresh the cache once a day at 3am
